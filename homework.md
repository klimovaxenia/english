##### My name is John

Hi! Nice to meet you! My name is John Smith. I am 19 and a student in college. I go to college in New York.  
My favorite courses are Geometry, French, and History. English is very hard course for me.  
My professors are very friendly and smart. It’s my second year in college now. I love it!

I live in a big house on Ivy Street. It’s close to the college campus. I live in the house with three other students.  
Their names are Bill, Tony, and Paul. We help each other with homework. On the weekend, we play football together.

I have a brother. He just started high school. He is 14 and lives with my parents.  
They live on Mulberry Street in Boston. Sometimes they visit me in New York.  
I am happy when they visit. My Mom always brings me sweets and candy when they come. I really miss them, too!
